### Research Interests
* I am developing risk assessments on international seafood consumption, identifying how countries' seafood reliance and social-economic structures impact food security.
* I am also working to treat data disparities in global seafood trade data to ensure more reliable risk assessments. This involves Bayesian statistics and leveraging high performance computers.
